- scripting functionality in Python
- upload obj files from computer
- export to itch.io

Go to: https://jackw1111.github.io/game-tool/build/asmjs.html

*TO DO*
- fix (webgl) bug when loading on mobile devices
- fix input bugs when clicking execute multiple times, fullscreen bugs in itch.io, memory bugs after pressing execute several times
- optimize performance, perhaps only delete and reinitialize setup() and update() instead of 
the whole application
- make sure all global objects are deleted between seperate executions
- cleanup codebase
- build a pretty front end, code editor etc...
